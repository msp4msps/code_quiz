# code_quiz

The following project was conducted to create an application that takes a user through a quiz on javascript. The quiz is timed and the goal is to complete the quiz as fast as possible. The score given is related to the time that is counting down as a user completes the quiz. 10 seconds is deducted if the user gets the question incorrect.
